\hypertarget{index_intro}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro}
this project is a didactic project which aim is to model and simulate the evolution of an ecosystem.\hypertarget{index_features}{}\section{Model Features}\label{index_features}
the ecosystem is developed to have the following features:\hypertarget{index_n_species}{}\subsection{N Species}\label{index_n_species}
the ecosystem could have n species whith different parameters\hypertarget{index_mutual_appetite}{}\subsection{Mutual Appetite}\label{index_mutual_appetite}
each species could like, and so eat, each other. selected a species the user can set how much a species like another. rabbit like carrot but doesn't like wolf.\hypertarget{index_gender}{}\subsection{Vivent Gender}\label{index_gender}
vivent could have a gender: male, female, asexual, ermaphrodite. in this realize animals could only be male or female. no vegetable reproduction is modeled nor implemented so vegetable gender is only asexual;\hypertarget{index_purposes}{}\section{Purposes}\label{index_purposes}
as already said this project has only didactic purposes. i can't really assure that it can produce good result from a scientific point of view. my real purpose was to develop something that could be expanded easily in future realizes, and of course have practice whith OO programming and boost features like multi index containers which are the key components of this project.\hypertarget{index_vivent_model}{}\section{Vivent Model}\label{index_vivent_model}
vivent are modelized giving them differents parameters. you can see them by looking to the vivent's inheritance tree.
