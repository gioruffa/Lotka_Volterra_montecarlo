\subsection{Detailed Description}
classes to manipulate and determine the time of the system is really difficult to determine time in this context.

we have developed two types of time: relative and absolute

relative time: the easyest way is to think to what is a ecosistem cicle. An ecosistem cicle is concluded when all the animals in the ecosistem where called. for \char`\"{}call\char`\"{} we intend every time a form of life interact with another form of life, so if an animal fight whith another this constitutes o total of 2 calls) as you can imagine it could be really difficult to controll that all the animals were called so if we give to te ecosistem cicle a value of 1, each call to an animal has the time value interval of 1/total\_\-number\_\-of\_\-forms\_\-of\_\-life present in the ecosistem. so the running relative time is the number of cicles passed and the quantiti of the cicle running

absolute time: nothing different from the number of calls occured from the creation of the first form of life
