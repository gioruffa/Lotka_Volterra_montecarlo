/*!	\mainpage Ecosystem Simulator
*
*	\section intro Introduction
*
*	this project is a didactic project which aim is to 
*	model and simulate the evolution of an ecosystem.
*
*	\section features	Model Features
*	the ecosystem is developed to have the following features:
*	
*			\subsection n_species N Species
*			the ecosystem could have n species whith different 
*			parameters
*
*			\subsection mutual_appetite Mutual Appetite
*			each species could like, and so eat, each other.
*			selected a species the user can set how much a species
*			like another. rabbit like carrot but doesn't like wolf.
*
*			\subsection gender Vivent Gender
*			vivent could have a gender: male, female, asexual, 
*			ermaphrodite. in this realize animals could only
*			be male or female. 
*			no vegetable reproduction is modeled nor implemented
*			so vegetable gender is only asexual;
*			
*	\section purposes Purposes
*	as already said this project has only didactic purposes.
*	i can't really assure that it can produce good result
*	from a scientific point of view.
*	my real purpose was to develop something that could be 
*	expanded easily in future realizes, and of course
* have practice whith OO programming and boost features 
*	like multi index containers which are the key components 
*	of this project.
*
*	\section vivent_model Vivent Model
*	vivent are modelized giving them differents parameters.
*	you can see them by looking to the vivent's inheritance tree.
